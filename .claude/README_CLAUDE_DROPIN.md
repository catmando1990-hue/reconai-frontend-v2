# Claude Drop‑In Pack — ReconAI Website Developer

This pack is designed to be pasted into **Claude Code (VS Code)** as your “system / project instructions”
so Claude behaves like a disciplined website developer for reconaitechnology.com.

## What’s inside
- `CLAUDE_MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`  → paste into Claude as the main instruction set
- `CLAUDE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`      → how YOU should format prompts
- `CLAUDE_DEV_LOOP_CHECKLIST.md`   → the required workflow Claude must follow

## How to use (fastest)
1) Download + unzip this pack.
2) Open `CLAUDE_MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and copy ALL contents.
3) Paste it at the start of your Claude Code chat (or set as project instructions).
4) Use `CLAUDE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` for your requests.

## Optional (recommended)
Add this line to the TOP of every Claude session prompt:
“Read and follow /ai-system/constitution.md and /ai-system/prompt-template.md strictly.”

## Notes
- This pack does NOT modify your repo by itself. It’s an instruction kit for Claude.
- If you want me to generate a repo file like `.claude/CLAUDE.md` next (auto-loaded by some setups),
  tell me what Claude tool you’re using (Claude Code vs Cursor vs other).
