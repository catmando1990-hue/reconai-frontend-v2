# Authenticated Playwright CI Lane
#
# PURPOSE: Run full dashboard E2E tests with real Clerk authentication
# SECURITY: Uses Clerk backend SDK, not UI automation. Fails closed on any error.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - CLERK_SECRET_KEY (GitHub Secret)
# - CLERK_CI_USER_ID (GitHub Secret) - dedicated CI test user
#
# This workflow does NOT weaken authentication. It creates a real session
# for a dedicated CI user via Clerk's backend API.
